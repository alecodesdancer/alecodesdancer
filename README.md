## Hi there! I'm Ale 🌻👋

 *Your only limit is your mind ❤️*
 
 I'm a JavaScript programmer. I love the *Frontend* but I also get into the *Backend* (The best of two worlds 🤩). 

⭐ When I learn something new I like to create apps and examples and share them here so that my future self is not so lost. If my examples help you, welcome 🤗.
🔭 I’m currently working on a mental health app 💕.

#### About me:
